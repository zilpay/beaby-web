## FAQ

**What is NTRU Prime and why does Bearby use it?**
NTRU Prime is a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism based on lattice problems (specifically the NTRU lattice problem), developed by Daniel J. Bernstein and colleagues. Bearby uses the Streamlined NTRU Prime variant (sntrup761) because it avoids the algebraic structure of module lattices used by CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST FIPS 203), providing a more conservative security foundation. NTRU Prime was a Round 4 finalist in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process.

**When will quantum computers threaten existing crypto wallets?**
NIST estimates that cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) capable of breaking 256-bit elliptic-curve cryptography (ECDSA/secp256k1) may emerge within 10–15 years. All major wallets today — MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom — rely on ECDSA, which Shor's algorithm running on a CRQC could break. Bearby already protects your stored key material with a post-quantum key-encapsulation layer (NTRU Prime), guarding it against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks; on-chain transaction signing still uses classical ECDSA, like other wallets today.

**What does non-custodial mean?**
A non-custodial wallet means users — and only users — control their private keys. No company, server, or third party ever has access to keys or funds. Bearby generates and stores all keys locally on the device using on-device encryption. There is no account registration and zero data collection.

**Which blockchain networks does Bearby support?**
Bearby supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all EVM-compatible chains including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, Linea, and Zilliqa. Additional EVM chains can be added manually via custom RPC configuration.

**Is Bearby open source?**
Yes. Bearby's cryptographic core is written in Rust and published as open-source software at github.com/bearbywallet. The open-source model allows independent security researchers to audit the cryptographic implementation and key management logic.
